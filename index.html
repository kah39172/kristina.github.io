    <font-size:5> <b> About Me </b> </font-size:5>
         
       <p> My name is Kristina and I am a sophomore at UGA, majoring in Sport Management. My main passion is <em>horseback riding</em>. I started riding when I was 4 years old and it has been my life ever since. I used to travel all around the southeast competing at shows, in hopes of one day making the NCAA UGA Equestrian team. As a freshman, I tried out for the team and to my surprise I made it. I had worked my whole life to accomplish this goal, and I finally saw the hardwork pay off. Being on the team was one of the best experiences I could've asked for, and has made my college experience unforgettable. </p>

       <p>Another passion of mine is <em>fitness</em>. I have always loved staying active, whether it was <ul>
       <li>trying new sports</li>
       <li>going hiking</li>
       <li>riding bikes</li>
       <li>swimming</li>
       <li>playing some beach volleyball.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>My love of sports runs in the family, with all of my immediate family members having played and watched sports their whole lives. Because of this love for sports and fitness, I decided to major in Sport Management. I am very excited to be working at a gym this summer, in hopes of furthering my career in the fitness industry. Here is a quote that I have always found funny, but inspiring when I am not feeling like workoing out hard: </p>

       <p>My other passion is <em>food</em>. I love to bake and cook, but my favorite thing to make is dessert. This is something I love to do with my mom when I am home from college. When holidays come around my mom and I are always the ones to make all the food, and we love it! There's so much to cook that we always start <acronym title="as soon as possible">ASAP</acronym>. It's something we can always do together, and food makes others gather around. This gathering over food leads to creating countless memories with friends and loved ones, which is one of the things I treasure most in life.
